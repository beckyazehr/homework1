Refactoring Horiseon Webpage

Description
Horiseon webpage codebase has been refactored to follow accessibility standards.

Usage
Creating sections of the page flow logically in a semantic fashion and using alternate descriptions of images creates a webpage that is accessible.  Having a webpage that is accessibility friendly can lead to a higher position on search engine results which brings more traffic on the page.  Accessibility is important for users who use screen readers and cannot use the page without the added attributes that make the page work with the screen readers; also for users who have slower Internet that makes it difficult to load images/videos.
